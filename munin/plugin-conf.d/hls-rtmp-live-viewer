# comma-separated list of urls to ask for rtmp-statistics
#env.RTMP_STAT_URLS http://127.0.0.1/stats/rtmp

# in a multi-worker-environment you'll need this patch and configure the stat-urls like this:
#env.RTMP_STAT_URLS http://127.0.0.1:8000/stats/rtmp,http://127.0.0.1:8001/stats/rtmp,http://127.0.0.1:8002/stats/rtmp

# path to the access-log containing the hls-file-logs
#env.HLS_ACCESSLOG /var/log/nginx/access.log

# list of hls-playlists, glob-wildcards are allowed
#env.HLS_PLAYLISTS /tmp/hls/*.m3u8

# configured target-size of a fragment
#env.HLS_FRAGMENT_SIZE 10

# how log should viewers be counted as "live"
# viewer will seem to stay online for that number of seconds, even if they have already switched off
# setting it too low will wipe players out of the statistics which lag behind
# do not set lower then 2Ã—HLS_FRAGMENT_SIZE seconds; good results can be achieved with 30-120 seconds
#env.HLS_FRAGMENT_WINDOW 30
